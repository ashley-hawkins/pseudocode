Unlike in slides, commented and empty lines do count towards the line numbers used for `goto line` statements.

The line number used in the `goto line` statement will just be the line number shown by any text editor that supports showing line numbers.

Example of how to use it:

`cargo run fibonacci.proceduralimp`
